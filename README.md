# Neural Networks from Scratch using NumPy

This repository contains two simple feedforward neural networks impletemted from scratch using NumPy. Both models are trained on logic-based binary classification tasks:

- 'xor/': learns the XOR function
- 'majority-vote/': predicts majority from binary vectors

Features:

- Manual forward and backward propagation
- ReLU and Sigmoid activations
- Weight and bias updates without external ML libraries
- Human-readable code structure
- Basic CLI for test inputs
